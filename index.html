  Hello everyone, I am Luis Garcia. Like many of you I’m also in the 3+1 program.
  Well, what is can I say. It is nice to see many old faces in class. 
  I hope that I get the chance to work with all of you this semester. 
  By the end of the 3+1 program I would like to be able to start my career as Software Developer.
  I know that it might not be possible right when I finish school but that is my end goal.  
  As for how I would describe myself, I would say that I am a quiet person but that tends to change once 
  I get to know the people around me.
  So yeah just come up to me and say hello. 
  I also enjoy spending my time watching classic action movies from the 80’s and 90’s.
  I would also consider myself an avid fan of video games old and new.
