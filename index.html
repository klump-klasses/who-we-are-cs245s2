I am Yuserah Din. I am currently in my senior year of the 3+1 CS program. This is my last semester. My goal is to be a Software 
  or Web Developer. I've was born in Chicago and have lived here my whole life. When I'm not building websites to showcase on my 
  portfolio, I like to read, watch TV, bake, and spend time with family.
